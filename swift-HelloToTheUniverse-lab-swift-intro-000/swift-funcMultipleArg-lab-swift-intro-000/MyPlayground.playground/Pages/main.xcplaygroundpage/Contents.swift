/*: question1
 ### 1. Create a function that will take in a continent and the number of countries in that continent. It should print the following sentence "____ is a continent which contains ___ countries".
 */
func continentCountries (name countryGroup:String, number continents:Int) {
    print("\(countryGroup) is a continent which contains \(continents) countries")
}
// write your code here

continentCountries(name: "Australasia", number: 2)



/*: question2
 ### 2. Can you see why the code below doesn't work? Fix the function call to get rid of the error.
 */
func greeting(name: String, greeting: String) {
    print("\(greeting), \(name)!")
}

greeting(name: "Danny", greeting:"Hello")




/*: question3
 ### 3. This function doesn't work, either. Can you fix the function (_not_ the call) so that it works?
 */
func daysInMonth(month: String, days: Int) {
    print("There are \(days) in \(month)")
}

daysInMonth(month: "November", days: 30)




/*: question4
 ### 4. So far, you have created functions that take two arguments. Can you create (and call) one that takes three? Try to create a function that three parameters: a beverage, the number of bottles of that beverage, and a place you can keep those bottles. Print the sentence "____ bottles of ____ on the ____ wall."
 */
func wineStorage(vintage wine:String, number bottles:Int, storage location:String) {
    print("There are \(bottles) bottles of the \(wine) within the \(location)")
}
wineStorage(vintage:"Merlot", number:12, storage:"Cellar")
