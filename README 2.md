# Common Issues

**Make sure that you went through all instructions in the Welcome Reading which can be found [here]( https://github.com/learn-co-curriculum/swift-welcome) before proceeding with this lesson, otherwise your lights will not work!**

It's important that you fork the lab over to your personal GitHub account (instructions below in video) before you clone down the lab to your machine!

Make sure you're running the latest version of Xcode, which is Xcode 8.0.



# Course Overview 

Let's talk first about how this course is organized. Every single piece of content on our platform is called a lesson. There are two types of lessons on Learn: Readings and Labs.

### Labs

Labs are lessons with a coding challenge you must complete. A lab will require you to write code and submit a solution.

You'll know if a lesson on Learn is a lab by the actions the right column asks you to take. It will ask you to Fork the Lab and submit a pull request. Some of the labs are tested where there might be an action that states that you should pass all local tests.


### Readings

Readings are lessons that only have instructional content. They provide context and exposition on a topic by breaking concepts down. Readings are how you learn enough to solve a lab.




# Instructions (video)

If you prefer to read detailed instructions on how to complete this lab (instead of a video), you can find detailed instructions [here](https://github.com/learn-co-curriculum/swift-HelloToTheUniverse-lab/blob/master/Detail.md)

# If the light's aren't turning green.

* Make sure you forked the lab over to _your_ account before cloning
* Make sure you have an SSH key setup property with Github (instructions above in the common issues section).
* Make sure you're running Xcode 8
* Run this command in Terminal, be prepared to type in your github username  
`bash <(curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/flatiron-school/ios-setup/master/install.sh)`
* Re-fork the lab and run the tests again (instructions to do that can be found [here](https://youtu.be/CsMDUFyyiNI))
* If after all of that you're unable to get the light to turn green, move forward to the next lesson and continue learning! Don't let that light hold you back from becoming a Swift Ninja
